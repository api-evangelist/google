## APIs

### Google Cloud API Gateway
API Gateway enables you to provide secure access to your backend services
through a well-defined REST API that is consistent across all of your
services, regardless of the service implementation. Clients consume your
REST APIS to implement standalone apps for a mobile device or tablet,
through apps running in a browser, or through any other type of app that
can make a request to an HTTP endpoint.
