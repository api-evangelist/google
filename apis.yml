      API Gateway enables you to provide secure access to your backend services
      through a well-defined REST API that is consistent across all of your
      services, regardless of the service implementation. Clients consume your
      REST APIS to implement standalone apps for a mobile device or tablet,
      through apps running in a browser, or through any other type of app that
      can make a request to an HTTP endpoint.
